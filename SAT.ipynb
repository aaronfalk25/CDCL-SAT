Like, in the above example, there are 3 variables and 2 clauses. The next lines of the file are the clauses. Each clause ends with 0. In the input format, each variable is defined by a number. So, we have literals like 1, -2, 3 and so on. Let there be V number of variables. Positive literals are like 1,2,3,4...V and we store them like this only. For the negative literals, -1,-2,..-V, we will add V to its absolute value. That is, -1,-2,-3 ... -V will be represented by V+1,V+2..V+V. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Concept of Watched Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "A major step while solving the SAT problem is the Boolean Constraint Propogation (BCP) which is responsible for making implications after performing propogation once a variable is decided. Suppose we have a 3 literal clause (1,-2,3) and in the first 2 deciding steps, we set 1 as False and 2 as True. So, to make this clause true, we have to set 3 as true. This is basically what is intended by BCP. A naive approach for doing so would be that whenever a variable is set, we traverse each clause and find such clauses where all but 1 literals have been falsed. This would be very expensive as we will have to traverse all the literals every time a decision is made. And as many decisions are made, BCP is indeed an important step and should be done faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fasten the BCP, we observe that if for any clause, we have 2 literals that are not set false, then it can not pariticipate in BCP at this step. This is because as both the literals are not false, then either atleast one is true which means that the clause is already valid and can not be used to conclude anything or both are not set, which means that there are atleast two literals not defined and thus we can not say anything about the clause at this step. So, for all clauses, we keep 2 watch literals all the time with the invariant that each of them is not false if the clause is not satisfied. Now, whenever we set a variable, say 2 as in the above example and we set it to true. This means that the literal -2 (5) has been falsified and so we only go to clauses watched by -2 and search for a new watcher for them. If we get a new watcher for them, then it is fine else we are left with only one undecided literal in it (the other watcher) and that is now implied."

    "We are implementing the CDCL (Conflict Driven Clause Learning) approach to solve the SAT problem. In this, whenever we have a conflict, we derive a conflict clause and add it to our clause database. Adding this clause will help the solver ignore this conflict path in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we create the Implication Graph, then a conflict clause can be thought of as a cut in the graph. A conflict clause has the sufficient literals such that if all are false together, then the same conflict will rise again and so this conflict clause should be true and thus is added to the clause database. But, there can be many potential conflict clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BackJumping\n",
    "\n",
    "In normal backtracking approach, whenever we reach a conflict, we backtrack one level and reverse that decision and try again. But, in the CDCL approach, we use the concept of backjump where we jump to a higher level which is decided by the conflict clause. Say the conflict occured at Level L. For all the literals in our conflict clause, we will take the levels at which they were set and find the maximum level less than L. Let's call this $L_{Backjump}$. We will then jump to $L_{Backjump}$ and undo all the decisions and implications that were made at levels greater than $L_{Backjump}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the right Conflict Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the level where conflict arised be L. We will choose a conflict clause that will have only one literal (say l) set at the level L. If this is the case, then as seen above, when we jump back using this clause, only this literal l will not be set and all other literals will be false and so we will have a new implication of l at that level which can then lead to further new implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This one literal l, set at the conflict level L will be chosen as the first Unique Implication Point (UIP). A UIP in a implication graph is a node that occurs on all paths from the decision node at that level to the conflict node. First UIP is the UIP closest to the conflict node.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the conflict clause with only one node set at level L and that too, the first UIP, we use the following algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with the clause C set as the clause that caused the conflict.\n",
    "2. Find out the latest assigned (implied) variable (say V) in C.\n",
    "3. Let the clause that caused the implication of V be C1.\n",
    "4. Set C to the binary resolution of C and C1 with respect to the variable V.\n",
    "   Binary resolution of Clause1 = (p1,p2,p3,...pn,a) and Clause2 = (q1,q2,q3,...qn,-a) with respect to the variable a is the clause (p1,p2,p3,...pn,q1,q2,q3,...qn)\n",
    "5. If C is such that it has only one literal set at L, then this is the final conflict clause. Else the steps\n",
    "   2-4 are repeated until the final conflict clause (with only one literal set at the conflict level L which also corresponds to the first UIP) is obtained.\n",
